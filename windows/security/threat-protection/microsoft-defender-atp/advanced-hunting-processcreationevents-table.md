| InitiatingProcessAccountSid | string | Security Identifier (SID) of the account that ran the process responsible for the event |
| InitiatingProcessLogonId | string | Identifier for a logon session of the process that initiated the event. This identifier is unique on the same machine only between restarts. |
| InitiatingProcessIntegrityLevel | string | Integrity level of the process that initiated the event. Windows assigns integrity levels to processes based on certain characteristics, such as if they were launched from an internet download. These integrity levels influence permissions to resources |
| InitiatingProcessTokenElevation | string | Token type indicating the presence or absence of User Access Control (UAC) privilege elevation applied to the process that initiated the event |
| InitiatingProcessSHA1 | string | SHA-1 of the process (image file) that initiated the event |
